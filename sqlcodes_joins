full outer join SQL_practice.dbo.employeesalary 
on employeedemorgraphics.employeeid = employeesalary.employeeid

joining two tables using employee_id (left outer join) -- only going to show the values of left side table which is employeedemographics and have null in the values that are in the right side

left outer join SQL_practice.dbo.employeesalary 
on employeedemorgraphics.employeeid = employeesalary.employeeid

joining two tables using employee_id (right outer join) --
select *
