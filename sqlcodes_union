#A union is how you can combine rows together- not columns like we have been doing with joins where one column is put next to another
#Joins allow you to combine the rows of data

#Now you should keep it the same kind of data otherwise if you start mixing tips with first_names it would be really confusing, but you can do it.
#Let's try it out and use Union to bring together some random data, then we will look at an actual use case
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employee_demographics
UNION
SELECT occupation, salary
FROM employee_salary;
